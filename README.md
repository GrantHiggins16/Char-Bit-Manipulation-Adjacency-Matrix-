# Char-Bit-Manipulation-Adjacency-Matrix-
Creates an adjacency matrix with full functionality by manipulating the bits of chars. Due to the way c++ stores chars and bools, 
this is a more efficient method than creating a matrix of bools.
To create a matrix, direct a file to the program with the desired size as the first input and then a list of node pairs after.
